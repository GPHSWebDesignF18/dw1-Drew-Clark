<body>
	I would like to pick mobile applications developer as my career for many reasons. They can make anywhere from $85,000-$125,000 a year, which is a lot of money. Also the job seems to be a bit challenging and I like a challenge. Lastly I would like this to be my career because it seems like a fun job and you can make a pretty good living doing it too.
